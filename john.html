		<summary>My Childhood</summary>
		<p>
               All of us have memories, both good and bad. Growing up, I had a very loving family. All I could think about was playing all day. I like sports, basketball, volleyball and baseball.I have a lot of true friends in my youth days and many crazy things have been done. Now if you all remember the craziest things you did  just laugh when you talk about it.
